They were also one of the most successful classes of animal ever, existing for over 300 million years. Some 50,000 species have been identified in sizes ranging from three millimeters to over two feet! Alas, that is the very limit of my enthusiasm for them, though, they look rather too much like bugs.","hhaBasePoints":87,"size":"1x1","museum":"Room 1","interact":false,"catalog":"Not for sale","variants":[{"image":"https://acnhcdn.com/latest/FtrIcon/FtrFossilTrilobite.png","filename":"FtrFossilTrilobite","uniqueEntryId":"qFoqCvDTBd2oyC5Gz","colors":["Beige","Brown"],"source":["Assessing fossils"],"internalId":303,"buy":-1,"sell":1300,"themes":[]}]}
