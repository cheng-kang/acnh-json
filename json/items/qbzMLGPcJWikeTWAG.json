{"sourceSheet":"Fossils","name":"spino skull","fossilGroup":"Spinosaurus","description":"Ahem. Yes. The Spinosaurus was a very large, carnivorous dinosaur, roughly the size of a T. Rex. Unlike its more famous cousin, however, Spinosaurus seems to have spent a great deal of time in water. Similar to modern crocodiles, this creature lived on a diet of fish AND land-dwelling animals. Personally, I am simply relieved that it did not seek FLYING prey.","hhaBasePoints":87,"size":"2x2","museum":"Room 2","interact":true,"catalog":"Not for sale","variants":[{"image":"https://acnhcdn.com/latest/FtrIcon/FtrFossilSpinosaurusA.png","filename":"FtrFossilSpinosaurusA","uniqueEntryId":"qbzMLGPcJWikeTWAG","colors":["Brown","Brown"],"source":["Assessing fossils"],"internalId":222,"buy":-1,"sell":4000,"themes":[]}]}
