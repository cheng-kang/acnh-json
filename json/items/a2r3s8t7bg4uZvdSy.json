Those sturdy legs, that magnificent tail, and, above all, that extraordinary neck! Did you know that its center of gravity was such that sitting up on its hind legs was probably easy? What's more, paired with its long neck, this ability greatly increased its reach for eating plants! Best of all, Diplodocus probably grew its entire life, having no \"adult size\". Would that we were all so gifted!","hhaBasePoints":87,"size":"2x2","museum":"Room 2","interact":false,"catalog":"Not for sale","variants":[{"image":"https://acnhcdn.com/latest/FtrIcon/FtrFossilDiplodocusF.png","filename":"FtrFossilDiplodocusF","uniqueEntryId":"a2r3s8t7bg4uZvdSy","colors":["Brown","Brown"],"source":["Assessing fossils"],"internalId":7251,"buy":-1,"sell":4000,"themes":[]}]}
