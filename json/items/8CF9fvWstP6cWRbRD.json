{"sourceSheet":"Fossils","name":"megacero skull","fossilGroup":"Megacerops","description":"Hoo! I had been hoping someone would bring me a Megacerops! This large fellow was a bit like our modern rhinoceros, but with two horns on its nose! Sadly, their small teeth restricted them to a diet of rather soft plants, and eventually they died out.
