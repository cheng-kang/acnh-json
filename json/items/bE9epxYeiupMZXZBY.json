Manet's works are notable for their lack of linear perspective and strong color contrast. These attributes led some to call him \"The Father of Impressionism\"and make comparisons to Vélazquez. Fun fact-flautists can determine what note the boy is playing just by studying the painting closely.","sourceNotes":null,"hhaBasePoints":451,"interact":false,"tag":"Picture","speakerType":null,"lightingType":null,"catalog":"Not for sale","versionAdded":"1.2.0","unlocked":true,"set":null,"series":null,"variants":[{"image":"https://acnhcdn.com/latest/FtrIcon/FtrArtFifePlayer.png","filename":"FtrArtFifePlayer","uniqueEntryId":"bE9epxYeiupMZXZBY","colors":[],"source":["Jolly Redd's Treasure Trawler"],"internalId":48,"genuine":true,"buy":4980,"sell":1245,"themes":["expensive","facility"],"highResTexture":null}]}
