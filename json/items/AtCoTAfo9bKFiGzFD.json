{"sourceSheet":"Fossils","name":"dunkleosteus","fossilGroup":"dunkleosteus","description":"The dunkleosteus flourished long before the dinosaurs and was a sort of armored fish. Curiously, only fossils for the head and shoulders have been found. We must simply imagine the rest! While its face was rather frightening, I like to picture a cute little tail and perhaps some fluffy paws on its fins. Such speculation is not scientific, of course, and essentially amounts to paleontological fan fiction. I own that.","hhaBasePoints":87,"size":"2x2","museum":"Room 1","interact":false,"catalog":"Not for sale","variants":[{"image":"https://acnhcdn.com/latest/FtrIcon/FtrFossilDunkleosteus.png","filename":"FtrFossilDunkleosteus","uniqueEntryId":"AtCoTAfo9bKFiGzFD","colors":["Gray","Brown"],"source":["Assessing fossils"],"internalId":4660,"buy":-1,"sell":3500,"themes":[]}]}
