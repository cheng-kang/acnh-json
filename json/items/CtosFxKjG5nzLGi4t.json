They were very sizableâ€”some 13 feet long, with a shell the size of a small car... If you're into that sort of thing. They likely ate seaweed, shrimp, octopus, and possibly ammonites, given the era involved. It seems CERTAIN giant turtles had to be prima donnas and eat some of the oldest life forms on earth!","hhaBasePoints":87,"size":"2x2","museum":"Room 2","interact":false,"catalog":"Not for sale","variants":[{"image":"https://acnhcdn.com/latest/FtrIcon/FtrFossilArchelonB.png","filename":"FtrFossilArchelonB","uniqueEntryId":"CtosFxKjG5nzLGi4t","colors":["Brown","Brown"],"source":["Assessing fossils"],"internalId":178,"buy":-1,"sell":3500,"themes":[]}]}
