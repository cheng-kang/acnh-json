It took Michelangelo more than three years to sculpt this piece. Close inspection shows heart- shaped eyes, but that's probably meant to depict light hitting them. Hearts didn't have the lovey-dovey symbolism back then that they do today.","sourceNotes":null,"hhaBasePoints":451,"interact":false,"tag":"Sculpture","speakerType":null,"lightingType":null,"catalog":"Not for sale","versionAdded":"1.2.0","unlocked":true,"set":null,"series":null,"variants":[{"image":"https://acnhcdn.com/latest/FtrIcon/FtrSculptureDavid.png","filename":"FtrSculptureDavid","uniqueEntryId":"hNbaWeaJCdihGnHM9","colors":[],"source":["Jolly Redd's Treasure Trawler"],"internalId":1333,"genuine":true,"buy":4980,"sell":1245,"themes":["expensive","folk art"],"highResTexture":null},{"image":"https://acnhcdn.com/latest/FtrIcon/FtrSculptureDavidFake.png","filename":"FtrSculptureDavidFake","uniqueEntryId":"aoJwhWz4TTkNHrgg4","colors":[],"source":["Jolly Redd's Treasure Trawler"],"internalId":1334,"genuine":false,"buy":4980,"sell":0,"themes":["horror"],"highResTexture":null}]}
